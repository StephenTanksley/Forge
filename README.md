# POE_Utility
This is a private repository for my work on the POE crafting utility.

This project is currently in development. When completed, this will be usable as a downloadable, standalone application to be used alongside the Path of Exile game window.

## USAGE

To use this application, a user will need to click the "Set target" buttons on the UI to capture the (x, y) coordinates of the items and currencies needed for crafting. 

Users will then be able to set limits on the duration that the application will run and the stats that they're targeting for that item's creation.

Users will also be able to watch the progress of the application toward the goal they've set by monitoring the panel in the right of the window.
